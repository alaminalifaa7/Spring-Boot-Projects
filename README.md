# Spring-Boot-Projects
Spring Boot projects that I am practicing will be uploaded here!!

The followings are what I am trying to learn starting from absolute basic of spring boot to advanced. 

Spring Boot allows to take an idea/prototype and turn it into a real thing in matters minutes hours of months and years. A lot of companies use Spring Boot because it's easy to setup, learn and write code very fast without having to setup the low level platform code. Recently, Netflix has decided to switch their entire backend to Spring Boot. This shows that Spring Boot is a must if you are or want to become a software engineer in the Java world. This course teaches how to build a full stack application from the ground up and touches on very import concepts used in real live software development. Concepts such as:

Spring Boot Backend API
Frontend with React.js Hooks and Functions Components
Frontend with Thymeleaf, CSS, Bootstrap
Maven/Gradle Build Tool
Databases using Postgres on Docker
Spring Data JPA
CRUD application using Controller, Service, Data Access Layer
Server and Client Side Error Handling
Packaging applications for deployment using Docker and Jib
AWS RDS & Elastic Beanstalk
Unit and Integration Testing

This repo is focused on learning the process needed to build your own apps and deploy to real users using real software development techniques and skills.
